\chapter*{Abstract}

Successful puzzle games have both been designed completely by hand and completely through computer generation. Can value be derived from combining both in a mixed-initiative fashion?
The aim of this thesis was to develop interactive tools that bring 'genuine value' to the process of puzzle game design, by which interactions are meant, which the designer could not easily attain through direct manipulation.
For this purpose we created MixedAim which is a tool that can give level suggestions   

. Through a qualitative user study we identified design approaches  designers employed to create puzzle games and analysed in which ways interactions with MixedAim supported these approaches.

We believe to have found 3 modes of designing a level.

Furthermore, we modelled the adaption of the designer towards the tool and analysed which adaptions were beneficial and why.

Finally, we found that these interactions should best be viewed as a set of tools with which one can design a level and not as a panacea   

 as giving a few more approaches to puzzle design but are not a panacea.


% Furthermore, we found that MixedAim, and for that matter other mixed-initiative tools, should be viewed as providing a few approaches for designing puzzles but they are not a panacea for design. 


% Concerns about creating easy levels.

\chapter*{Zusammenfassung}

Diese Arbeit beschäftigt sich mit der Entwicklung einer neuartigen Beispielausarbeitung. Wir untersuchen die Anforderungen, die sich für eine allgemeine Vorlage ergeben, die innerhalb der \LaTeX-Textverarbeitungsumgebung verwendet werden kann. (Und so weiter und so fort\dots) Die Zusammenfassung sollte nicht länger als eine halbe Textseite sein!
