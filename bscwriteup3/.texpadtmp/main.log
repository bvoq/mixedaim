Package scrbook Info: You've used standard option `12pt'.
(scrbook)             This is correct!
(scrbook)             Internally I'm using `fontsize=12pt'.
(scrbook)             If you'd like to set the option with \KOMAoptions,
(scrbook)             you'd have to use `fontsize=12pt' there
(scrbook)             instead of `12pt', too.


Class scrbook Warning: You've used obsolete option `nochapterprefix'.
(scrbook)              Usage of this option indicates an old document
(scrbook)              and changes compatibility level using
(scrbook)              `chapterprefix=false,version=first,
(scrbook)              enabledeprecatedfontcommands' that may result
(scrbook)              in further warnings.
(scrbook)              If you don't want this, you should simply
(scrbook)              replace option `nochapterprefix' by `chapterprefix=false'.

Class scrbook Info: Switching compatibility level to `first'.

Class scrbook Warning: deprecated option `enabledeprecatedfontcommands'.
(scrbook)              Note, that this option was already depreacted when
(scrbook)              it has been defined. Support for old font commands
(scrbook)              has been removed from KOMA-Script more than one
(scrbook)              decade ago. It is not recommended to use them any
(scrbook)              longer. Therefore usage of this class option also
(scrbook)              is not recommended.

Class scrbook Warning: deprecated old font command `\sc' used.
(scrbook)              You should note, that since 1994 LaTeX2e provides a
(scrbook)              new font selection scheme called NFSS2 with several
(scrbook)              new, combinable font commands. New KOMA-Script classes
(scrbook)              defined the old font commands like `\sc' only for
(scrbook)              compatibility with LaTeX 2.09 document styles of
(scrbook)              Script 2.0. These commands are deprecated and
(scrbook)              undocumented at least since 2003. Since 2013,
(scrbook)              KOMA-Script classes warned about soon removement of
(scrbook)              these deprecated commands. Now, after two decades of
(scrbook)              LaTeX2e, NFSS2, and KOMA-Script these commands will
(scrbook)              not work any longer. If loading a package results in

(scrbook)              package and ask him to replace the depracted font
(scrbook)              command `\sc', e.g., by `\normalfont \scshape '.
(scrbook)              Otherwise you should reconfigure or replace the
(scrbook)              package. If you have used the old font command
