Faster, felt like communication, not trivial.

I did more than I imagined I could with the tool.

Not really. Too few curated suggestion levels.

I was able to do more in a short amount of time and check more things than I would usually.

It felt like a communication with the exception of the things I controlled. (This participant only used the suggested buttons and did not implement his own transformation rules).

Well I kind of knew what it did after you explained it so it just did what I wanted it to do.

It allowed to limit well. 

It is not intelligent, it just did what I told it to do and it was a useful tool.

The role of saving levels, play them , finding their solutions and checking if it has solutions. Additionally, it brought me ideas and did its job quite well.

I did not look at the difficulty scores, just at the curated levels.

Yes, especially as a level of confidence so I was sure that the current design was pretty solid when the suggestions seemed worse.

Not for the game I'm currently working on but if I design puzzle levels again sure.

The limits are the language of PuzzleScript and the language of the transformer.

Potential is to create low effort levels and it allows you to constrain your creativity. There's a kind of Google Effect where I stop thinking about solvability. Probably if you've been designing puzzles for a specific game for a long period of time the tool probably won't help much anymore, so it's more useful in the prototype phase.



Too little solutions.
